# Invoice Maker

This is an app created with Apps Script which I use, in combination with a Google Sheet document, to create invoices for my music teaching business.

The app works mainly with three sheets: "Import calendar", "Students" and "Prices". It also has two hidden sheets that work as a template for each calendar's invoice.

### Main features: ###
* Import events within a month or between two custom dates from a selected calendar.
* Presents the events imported with a clear overview of each student's lessons.
* Create an invoice as a new sheet for selected students.
* Save the invoice as a pdf on the Drive.
* Open a modal to add new student.

### Features to add: ###
* Send the invoice as a pdf to the student
